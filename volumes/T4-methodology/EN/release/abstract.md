# Abstract

This treatise draws a strict boundary in public reasoning. Logic is an instrument for testing inference: it assesses whether a conclusion follows from granted premises, not whether an action, policy, or collective order is normatively permissible. Logic can secure validity. It cannot transform facts, formal consistency, or measurability into obligation without an explicitly stated normative premise. The is-ought gap marks this constraint.

It then diagnoses a civilisational drift. When Logic is absolutised as the sole judge of truth, public truth-criteria narrow into three seemingly objective substitutes: formal coherence, procedural compliance, and measurable indicators. A category mistake follows: validity is treated as permissibility, procedure as justice, and metrics as dignity. The result is metric sovereignty: measures become targets. Once measures become targets, institutions are driven toward instrumental optimisation and become structurally susceptible to manipulation, as captured by Goodhart's law and Campbell's law.

In public decision-making, the distortion becomes more exposed because collective orders necessarily contain value-conflicts and fairness trade-offs that cannot be settled by formal validity alone. The central question is therefore not only propositional truth, but standing to bind. A claim binds when it legitimately demands compliance, warrants sanction, restricts choice, and shapes the rules of shared life. The canonical thesis is that a truth-claim has standing to bind a civilisation only insofar as it can be examined and publicly accounted for as Akhlak: an observable trace of character and conduct across time and contexts, resistant to performative incentives and irreducible to rhetoric or procedural compliance.

T_v⇒A^+
Truth binds civilisation only insofar as it is proven and embodied in Akhlak.
