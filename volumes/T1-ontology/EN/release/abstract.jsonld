  "abstract": "The crisis now labeled \"post-truth\" is not treated here as a single symptom, but as a convergence of reinforcing currents: epistemic nihilism that corrodes binding force, postmodern relativism that dissolves boundaries, logical positivism and scientism that narrow truth to verification, techno-determinism that exchanges responsibility for system necessity, algorithmic reductionism that mistakes prediction for a substitute of accountability, and pragmatist-utilitarian habits that weigh \"truth\" by \"usefulness\". Across these variations, this treatise pins down one traceable pattern: the severing of the \"address of accountability\", namely the separation of a claim from the subject who must bear its consequences. This work restores Logic to its proper dignity as an instrument of clarity, then tests the moment it is enthroned as the source of legitimacy. When truth is reduced to procedural validity, what is preserved is form: consistency, coherence, compliance, and auditability. Yet binding force demands a harder condition: a decision must remain answerable to its bearer, together with its consequences, beneath Mizan as an obligating measure. By reading metric regimes in economic life and procedural neutrality in governance, the treatise shows how measurement becomes a target, distorts reality, and accelerates responsibility deflection. The thesis is simple and demanding: the true is not merely neat; it must bind. And what binds must be claimable at its address of accountability. The Cohesive Tetrad proposes a guarding configuration grounded in Sabda, Akal as the integrative inner faculty, Qualia, Mistika, and Akhlak, so that truth does not collapse into procedure without a bearer, semantics without responsibility, or numbers without a face.",
