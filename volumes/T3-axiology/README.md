## Semantic field of The Cohesive Tetrad
*The Cohesive Tetrad* (TCT) is an epistemic-and-ethical framework for **truth governance**. It begins from a structural fact: institutions, technologies, and communities do not “speak truth” in a single register. They operate with different idioms (procedural validity, technical optimization, narrative legitimacy), while the human subject remains accountable before a measure higher than power, appetite, or efficiency. TCT therefore serves as a governance grammar: it assigns **jurisdiction** to distinct truth-languages and blocks the typical substitution error whereby an instrument (metrics, prediction, procedure, formal coherence) is crowned as the supreme norm.

TCT articulates four interdependent languages of truth:

- **Sabda (Revelatory Word, the authoritative source of norm and telos)**  
  Sabda denotes authoritative normative utterance: revelation, firman, decree, and norm-giving discourse that sets direction, boundary, and ends. In TCT, Sabda stands as the highest source of norm and telos, against which the legitimacy of policies, institutions, and claims must be measured.

- **Logic**  
  Logic is the disciplined order of reasoning that organizes concepts, propositions, implications, and inference so judgments can be tested, corrected, and held answerable across time, disciplines, and traditions. It secures inferential soundness while remaining dependent on explicit normative premises for obligation.

- **Qualia**  
  Qualia names the phenomenal and lived dimension of truth: how claims, systems, and decisions are actually experienced by subjects, communities, and ecosystems. It forces truth governance to face felt impact, harm, dignity, and intelligibility, preventing “compliance” from masquerading as justice.

- **Mistika**  
  Mistika is a normative and transformative discipline of knowledge and practice concerning the epistemic condition of intention, the state of consciousness, and the inner orientation of the subject. It designates the interior work through which intention and perception are purified before what is ultimately real.

These four languages are woven into a single accountable order through **Akal as the Integrative Inner Faculty**, which coordinates norm, reason, experience, and inner orientation without reducing one to another. Their integration is not merely conceptual: it is tested in history on the surface of **Akhlak**.

In this Tetralogy volume, the emphasis falls on **Akhlak as Embodiment**: Akhlak is the relatively stable configuration of **Virtue Ethics (Character Ethics)** and governance practice that repeatedly generates trustworthy, just, honest, compassionate, and dignifying action. Within TCT, Akhlak functions as the observable surface of verification: Sabda, Logic, Qualia, and Mistika are treated as valid for governance only insofar as they leave a durable, auditable trace in character and conduct across time and context.
