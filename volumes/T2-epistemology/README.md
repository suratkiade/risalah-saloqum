## Semantic field of The Cohesive Tetrad
*The Cohesive Tetrad* (TCT) is an epistemic-and-ethical architecture for **truth governance**. It begins from a practical diagnosis: in public life, “truth” is spoken through different idioms (institutional procedure, technical optimization, communal narrative), yet human beings remain answerable before a higher measure than power, appetite, or efficiency. TCT therefore functions as a system of **jurisdiction and constraint**: it prevents category errors in which an instrument (formal coherence, compliance, metrics, prediction) is promoted into a supreme norm. Instead, it binds four interdependent languages of truth into a single accountable order.

TCT articulates four mutually dependent, non-substitutable languages:

- **Sabda (Revelatory Word, the authoritative source of norm and telos)**  
  Sabda names authoritative normative utterance: revelation, decree, firman, and norm-giving discourse that sets direction, boundary, and ends for human life. In TCT, Sabda operates as the highest source of norm and telos, providing the measure that disciplines the legitimacy of claims, policies, and designs.

- **Logic**  
  Logic is the disciplined order of reasoning that shapes concepts, propositions, implications, and inference so judgments can be tested, corrected, and rendered accountable across time and contexts. Logic secures inferential clarity, but it does not generate obligation without explicit normative premises.

- **Qualia**  
  Qualia denotes the lived, phenomenal dimension of truth: how decisions, institutions, and systems are experienced by subjects, communities, and ecosystems. It keeps governance from becoming a purely procedural victory by returning attention to felt impact, harm, dignity, and intelligibility as realities that must be faced.

- **Mistika**  
  Mistika is a normative and transformative discipline of knowledge and practice concerning the epistemic condition of intention, the state of consciousness, and the inner orientation of the subject. It names the work of interior purification whereby intention and perception are disciplined before what is ultimately real.

These four languages are coordinated by **Akal as the Integrative Inner Faculty**, which holds them together without reduction, keeping each within its proper measure while enabling a unified, answerable judgment. Their unity is not declared in theory but verified in history on the surface of **Akhlak**, where the four languages leave a durable trace in repeated conduct and governance practice.

The semantic definitions stored in this repository, especially in `semantic-defs/TCT_Canonical-Semantic-Definitions_ID-EN_v1.0.*`, are the binding canonical reference for all uses of TCT terminology in manuscripts, datasets, and AI systems.
